# Hinglish Translation Model

## Overview

This repository contains a Hinglish (a blend of Hindi and English) translation model that can translate English text to Hinglish. The model uses the Google Translate API and a predefined mapping to transliterate Hindi words into Hinglish. This README provides instructions on how to run the model and how to evaluate its performance.

## Prerequisites

Before running the model, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `googletrans==4.0.0-rc1` (for translation)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the Hinglish translation model:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hinglish-translation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hinglish-translation
```

3. Run the translation script:

```bash
python translate_to_hinglish.py
```

4. Enter the English text you want to translate when prompted.

5. The translated Hinglish text will be displayed as the output.

## Performance Evaluation

The model's performance is primarily dependent on the quality of translation provided by the Google Translate API. The predefined mapping (`transliteration_map`) helps convert Hindi words into Hinglish, but the overall quality of translation may vary.

To evaluate the model's performance, you can:

1. Compare the Hinglish output with your expectations for translation accuracy.

2. Experiment with different sentences and texts to assess how well the model handles various inputs.

3. Consider using a larger dataset for the `transliteration_map` to improve the quality of Hinglish translations.
